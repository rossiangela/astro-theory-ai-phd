## Independent PhD Summary – Angela Rossi

### Title

**Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Computational Astrophysics and Theoretical Physics**

---

### Research Proposal and Purpose

This independent PhD aims to explore how machine learning and computational tools can be used to simulate and analyze astrophysical phenomena, such as gravitational waves, black hole mergers, and spacetime curvature. The goal is to integrate theoretical physics with advanced computing to generate new insights, publishable simulations, and reproducible models. All work will be documented and shared openly through GitHub, Zenodo, and other public platforms.

**Key Research Question:**
*How can machine learning methods enhance the simulation of relativistic phenomena such as black hole mergers and gravitational wave propagation?*
